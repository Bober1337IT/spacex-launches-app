SpaceX Launches AppOverviewSpaceX Launches is an Android application that displays a list of SpaceX rocket launches, allowing users to view detailed information about each launch. The app fetches data from the SpaceX API, caches it locally using SQLDelight, and presents it in a modern UI built with Jetpack Compose. Users can view mission details, launch status, images (mission patches), and open related articles in a browser.FeaturesLaunch List: Displays a list of SpaceX launches with mission names and statuses, loaded from a local database or the SpaceX API.
Launch Details: Shows detailed information for a selected launch, including mission name, launch date, success status, details, mission patch images, and a link to an article.

Image Loading: Displays mission patch images (small and large) using Coil, with the large patch centered on the detail screen.
Clickable Article Links: Opens external articles in the deviceâ€™s browser with a single tap.
Modern UI: Built with Jetpack Compose for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
Navigation: Uses Jetpack Navigation for seamless transitions between the launch list and detail screens.
